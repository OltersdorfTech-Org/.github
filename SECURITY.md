# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Security updates are provided on a best-effort basis. For actively maintained repositories, please use the latest release or `main`.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please do **not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead:
1. Use GitHub’s private vulnerability reporting (if enabled), or
2. Contact the organization owners privately via GitHub.

Include:
- repo name + affected version/commit
- description of the issue
- steps to reproduce (if safe)
- potential impact

## Scope notes
Many O-Tech projects interact with hardware (GPIO, cameras, etc.). If a vulnerability could create unsafe physical behavior, treat it as **high severity** and report immediately.

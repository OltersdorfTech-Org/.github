# 🚀 OltersdorfTech-Org (O-Tech)

Welcome to **O-Tech** — where engineering curiosity meets maker ingenuity. We’re a community-driven lab of builders, tinkerers, and systems thinkers designing tools, frameworks, and story-driven experiences that empower creators of all scales.

Our work spans automation tooling, narrative maker experiences, reproducible hardware & software workflows, and open innovation that bridges real-world engineering with creative experimentation.

---

## 🌟 Mission

**Make engineering approachable, composable, and impactful.**  
We believe in:

- **Practical solutions**, not over-engineered abstractions.  
- **Transparent workflows** that others can learn from and build on.  
- **Story-forward tools** that bring delight into education and discovery.  
- **Open-source collaboration** across disciplines.

Whether it’s optimizing a CAD workflow, automating a build pipeline, or crafting an interactive maker narrative — O-Tech exists to lower barriers and elevate outcomes.
